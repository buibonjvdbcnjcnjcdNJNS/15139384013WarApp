            Hello,<br><br>

My name is Prince. In this section, I will talk about 2 aspects of the course I think to be challenging when study Cyber Security at Warwick and 2 that would be fulfilling.<br><br>

Two Modules I think would be particularly difficult for me would be: Data Science, Algorithms, and Complexity in the Cyber Context and Cyber Security Management. This is because although I do have some previous experience with data science, I did find it difficult. I did want to teach it myself and I did, however unlike automation and other programming concepts I didn't get the chance to reinforce it so I'm rusty. I know how to use applications like Conda so those should help me, I am familiar with writing algorithms. I hope that in learning this I will finally reinforce my understanding of machine learning. I would find Cybersecurity incident management hard as although it is not a completely unfamiliar topic, I haven't spent a lot of time patching the problems - It's not like I haven't patched any faulty software or fixed bugs, it's just not my speciality. Another topic I would find particularly fulfilling would be Software development and security, although I am mainly focussed on cybersecurity and pen testing, I have always enjoyed making software and other various programs. I would love to keep programming and make programs even while I am in university as I originally started with some python scripts and then one thing led to another and here I am. I feel the same about the cyber context of software engineering. I think it will be interesting to see how 2 topics, Cybersecurity and software engineering, cross over and study that.  

<br><br>

I am really looking forward to spending my time at warwick.
