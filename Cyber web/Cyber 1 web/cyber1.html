            Hello,<br><br>

My name is Prince. In this section, I will talk about everything I have done until now to prepare me to study Cyber Security at Warwick.<br><br>

I first learnt to program in python in highschool. Then my understanding of programming was very limited. I made a lot of errors and made a lot of stupid mistakes that looking back could've been easily fixed through a google search or asking for help. The problem was back then, I didn't do either of those things - I considered it "cheating". For that reason, I stayed at the same level, and made the same mistakes, like writing functions in the middle of programs, and not using arguments when calling functions. I remember the first time I asked for help was a friends friend. It was someone I did not know personally so I asked them to help me with a project. I wanted to make it so that I could adding the appropriate suffix for certain numbers like 'st' for 1 and so on. I didn't understand functions completely and someone helped and explained it to me. I also realised the same result would have been achieved by using google. Now I am a person who is very fluent in python. I have made a variety of projects. Everything from OOP to functional programming, data scrapers, web applications, web automation, self-replicating viruses, FUD backdoors and even machine learning. I have helped a lot of other people with programming, in real life and strangers online. I think learning to do proper research has helped me grow and I think it will show in modules like Software development and security as they are heavily based upon fundamental programming concepts which I am familiar in. The module programming Languages for Cybersecurity is also one that would be easier because of my previous knowledge in python.<br><br>

I have also taught myself a lot of pen testing practices and am now fluent with a command line. I have practised multiple attacks and exploited a lot of vulnerabilities. I have learnt both client and server-side attacks and methods of gaining information through tools like Maltego. I have studied methods to hack into networks, computers within those networks, websites and others. I think this will help greatly when studying cybersecurity at warwick. I've used tools like Miasm and x64dbg to analyse shellcode and assembly code.

<br><br>

I am really looking forward to spending my time at warwick.
